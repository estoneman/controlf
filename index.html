			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;Controlf is a searching website that tells users which search algorithm is the most efficient in finding certain phrases, words, or characters on websites. By importing a URL and a phrase, word, or character, Controlf works its magic by calculating how many times it occurs in the website using search algorithms [(INSERT THE ALGORITHMS HERE)]. To educate the users on these algorithms, this page will redirect you to a page that gives you a visualization of how long each algorithm took and the frequency of your input! This will show you which one was the fastest in finding your phrase, word, or character!</p>
